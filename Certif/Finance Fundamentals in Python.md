| Manipulating Time Series Data in Python         | In this course you'll learn the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. You'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. You'll also learn how resample time series to change the frequency. This course will also show you how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, you'll use all your new skills to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data.<br><br>1.Working with Time Series in Pandas<br>This chapter lays the foundations to leverage the powerful time series functionality made available by how Pandas represents dates, in particular by the DateTimeIndex. You will learn how to create and manipulate date information and time series, and how to do calculations with time-aware DataFrames to shift your data in time or create period-specific returns.<br><br>2. Basic Time Series Metrics & Resampling<br>This chapter dives deeper into the essential time series functionality made available through the pandas DataTimeIndex.

Index performance is then compared against benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the index you created.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 100%      |
| Importing and Managing Financial Data in Python | If you want to apply your new 'Python for Data Science' skills to real-world financial data, then this course will give you some very valuable tools. First, you will learn how to get data out of Excel into pandas and back. Then, you will learn how to pull stock prices from various online APIs like Google or Yahoo! Finance, macro data from the Federal Reserve, and exchange rates from OANDA. Finally, you will learn how to calculate returns for various time horizons, analyze stock performance by sector for IPOs, and calculate and summarize correlations.<br><br>1. Importing stock listing data from Excel<br>In this chapter, you will learn how to import, clean and combine data from Excel workbook sheets into a pandas DataFrame. You will also practice grouping data, summarizing information for categories, and visualizing the result using subplots and heatmaps. You will use data on companies listed on the stock exchanges NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX with information on company name, stock symbol, last market capitalization and price, sector or industry group, and IPO year. In Chapter 2, you will build on this data to download and analyze stock price history for some of these companies.<br><br>2. Importing financial data from the web<br>This chapter introduces online data access to Google Finance and the Federal Reserve Data Service through the `pandas` `DataReader`. You will pull data, perform basic manipulations, combine data series, and visualize the results.<br><br>3. Summarizing your data and visualizing the result<br>In this chapter, you will learn how to capture key characteristics of individual variables in simple metrics. As a result, it will be easier to understand the distribution of the variables in your data set: Which values are central to, or typical of your data? Is your data widely dispersed, or rather narrowly distributed around some mid point? Are there outliers? What does the overall distribution look like?<br><br>4. Aggregating and describing your data by category<br>This chapter introduces the ability to group data by one or more categorical variables, and to calculate and visualize summary statistics for each caategory. In the process, you will learn to compare company statistics for different sectors and IPO vintages, analyze the global income distribution over time, and learn how to create various statistical charts from the seaborn library.<br> | 100%      |
| Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python    | Have you ever had wondered whether an investment fund is actually a good investment? Or compared two investment options and asked what the difference between the two is? What does the risk indicator of these funds even mean? Or do you frequently work with financial data in your daily job and you want to get an edge? In this course, you’re going to get familiar with the exciting world of investing, by learning about portfolios, risk and return, and how to critically analyze them. By working on actual historical stock data, you’ll learn how to calculate meaningful measures of risk, how to break-down performance, and how to calculate an optimal portfolio for the desired risk and return trade-off. After this course, you’ll be able to make data-driven decisions when it comes to investing and have a better understanding of investment portfolios.<br><br>1. Introduction to Portfolio Analysis<br>In the first chapter, you’ll learn how a portfolio is build up out of individual assets and corresponding weights. The chapter also covers how to calculate the main characteristics of a portfolio: returns and risk.<br><br>2. Risk and Return<br>Chapter 2 goes deeper into how to measure returns and risk accurately. The two most important measures of return, annualized returns, and risk-adjusted returns, are covered in the first part of the chapter. In the second part, you’ll learn how to look at risk from different perspectives. This part focuses on skewness and kurtosis of a distribution, as well as downside risk.<br><br>3. Performance Attribution<br>In chapter 3, you’ll learn about investment factors and how they play a role in driving risk and return.
