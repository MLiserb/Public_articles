First, you'll learn about iterators, objects you have already encountered in the context of for loops. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools for all data professionals and developers working in Python. You'll end the course by working through a case study in which you'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this course.<br><br>1. Using iterators in PythonLand<br>You'll learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with when writing for loops. You'll learn some handy functions that will allow you to effectively work with iterators. And you’ll finish the chapter with a use case that is pertinent to the world of data science and dealing with large amounts of data—in this case, data from Twitter that you will load in chunks using iterators.<br><br>2. List comprehensions and generators<br>In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists—and lists of lists—in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory, but instead generate on the fly.<br><br>3. Bringing it all together!<br>This chapter will allow you to apply your newly acquired skills toward wrangling and extracting meaningful information from a real-world dataset—the World Bank's World Development Indicators. You'll have the chance to write your own functions and list comprehensions as you work with iterators and generators to solidify your Python chops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 100%         |

| Exploratory Data Analysis in Python                         | So you’ve got some interesting data - where do you begin your analysis? This course will cover the process of exploring and analyzing data, from understanding what’s included in a dataset to incorporating exploration findings into a data science workflow.<br><br>Using data on unemployment figures and plane ticket prices, you’ll leverage Python to summarize and validate data, calculate, identify and replace missing values, and clean both numerical and categorical values. Throughout the course, you’ll create beautiful Seaborn visualizations to understand variables and their relationships.<br><br>For example, you’ll examine how alcohol use and student performance are related. Finally, the course will show how exploratory findings feed into data science workflows by creating new features, balancing categorical features, and generating hypotheses from findings.<br><br>By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence to perform your own exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.You’ll be able to explain your findings visually to others and suggest the next steps for gathering insights from your data!<br><br>1. Getting to Know a Dataset<br>What's the best way to approach a new dataset? Learn to validate and summarize categorical and numerical data and create Seaborn visualizations to communicate your findings.<br><br>2. Data Cleaning and Imputation<br>Exploring and analyzing data often means dealing with missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers. In this chapter, you’ll learn techniques to handle these issues and streamline your EDA processes!<br><br>3. Relationships in Data<br>Variables in datasets don't exist in a vacuum; they have relationships with each other. In this chapter, you'll look at relationships across numerical, categorical, and even DateTime data, exploring the direction and strength of these relationships as well as ways to visualize them.<br><br>4.

| Working with Dates and Times in Python                      | You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion.<br><br>1. Dates and Calendars<br>Hurricanes (also known as cyclones or typhoons) hit the U.S. state of Florida several times per year. To start off this course, you'll learn how to work with date objects in Python, starting with the dates of every hurricane to hit Florida since 1950. You'll learn how Python handles dates, common date operations, and the right way to format dates to avoid confusion.<br><br>2. Combining Dates and Times<br>Bike sharing programs have swept through cities around the world -- and luckily for us, every trip gets recorded! Working with all of the comings and goings of one bike in Washington, D.C., you'll practice working with dates and times together. You'll parse dates and times from text, analyze peak trip times, calculate ride durations, and more.<br><br>3. Time Zones and Daylight Saving<br>In this chapter, you'll learn to confidently tackle the time-related topic that causes people the most trouble: time zones and daylight saving. Continuing with our bike data, you'll learn how to compare clocks around the world, how to gracefully handle "spring forward" and "fall back," and how to get up-to-date timezone data from the dateutil library.<br><br>4. Easy and Powerful: Dates and Times in Pandas<br>To conclude this course, you'll apply everything you've learned about working with dates and times in standard Python to working with dates and times in Pandas. With additional information about each bike ride, such as what station it started and stopped at and whether or not the rider had a yearly membership, you'll be able to dig much more deeply into the bike trip data. In this chapter, you'll cover powerful Pandas operations, such as grouping and plotting results by time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 100%         |

| Writing Functions in Python                                 | You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!<br><br>1. Best Practices<br>The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.<br><br>2. Context Managers<br>If you've ever seen the "with" keyword in Python and wondered what its deal was, then this is the chapter for you! Context managers are a convenient way to provide connections in Python and guarantee that those connections get cleaned up when you are done using them. This chapter will show you how to use context managers, as well as how to write your own.<br><br>3. Decorators<br>Decorators are an extremely powerful concept in Python. They allow you to modify the behavior of a function without changing the code of the function itself. This chapter will lay the foundational concepts needed to thoroughly understand decorators (functions as objects, scope, and closures), and give you a good introduction into how decorators are used and defined. This deep dive into Python internals will set you up to be a superstar Pythonista.<br><br>4. More on Decorators<br>Now that you understand how decorators work under the hood, this chapter gives you a bunch of real-world examples of when and how you would write decorators in your own code. You will also learn advanced decorator concepts like how to preserve the metadata of your decorated functions and how to write decorators that take arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 100%         |

| Sampling in Python                                          | Sampling in Python is the cornerstone of inference statistics and hypothesis testing. It's a powerful skill used in survey analysis and experimental design to draw conclusions without surveying an entire population. In this Sampling in Python course, you’ll discover when to use sampling and how to perform common types of sampling—from simple random sampling to more complex methods like stratified and cluster sampling. Using real-world datasets, including coffee ratings, Spotify songs, and employee attrition, you’ll learn to estimate population statistics and quantify uncertainty in your estimates by generating sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions.<br><br>1. Introduction to Sampling<br>Learn what sampling is and why it is so powerful. You’ll also learn about the problems caused by convenience sampling and the differences between true randomness and pseudo-randomness.<br><br>2. Sampling Methods<br>It’s time to get hands-on and perform the four random sampling methods in Python: simple, systematic, stratified, and cluster.<br><br>3. Sampling Distributions<br>Let’s test your sampling.

| Unsupervised Learning in Python                             | Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as Wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and SciPy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.<br><br>1. Clustering for Dataset Exploration<br>Learn how to discover the underlying groups (or "clusters") in a dataset. By the end of this chapter, you'll be clustering companies using their stock market prices, and distinguishing different species by clustering their measurements.<br><br>2. Visualization with Hierarchical Clustering and t-SNE<br>In this chapter, you'll learn about two unsupervised learning techniques for data visualization, hierarchical clustering and t-SNE. Hierarchical clustering merges the data samples into ever-coarser clusters, yielding a tree visualization of the resulting cluster hierarchy. t-SNE maps the data samples into 2d space so that the proximity of the samples to one another can be visualized.<br><br>3. Decorrelating Your Data and Dimension Reduction<br>Dimension reduction summarizes a dataset using its common occurring patterns. In this chapter, you'll learn about the most fundamental of dimension reduction techniques, "Principal Component Analysis" ("PCA"). PCA is often used before supervised learning to improve model performance and generalization. It can also be useful for unsupervised learning. For example, you'll employ a variant of PCA will allow you to cluster Wikipedia articles by their content!<br><br>4. Discovering Interpretable Features<br>In this chapter, you'll learn about a dimension reduction technique called "Non-negative matrix factorization" ("NMF") that expresses samples as combinations of interpretable parts. For example, it expresses documents as combinations of topics, and images in terms of commonly occurring visual patterns. You'll also learn to use NMF to build recommender systems that can find you similar articles to read, or musical artists that match your listening history!<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 100%         |

| Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python           | Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions.<br>In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.<br><br>1. Classification and Regression Trees<br>Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are a set of supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the CART algorithm.<br><br>2. The Bias-Variance Tradeoff<br>The bias-variance tradeoff is one of the fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning. In this chapter, you'll understand how to diagnose the problems of overfitting and underfitting. You'll also be introduced to the concept of ensembling where the predictions of several models are aggregated to produce predictions that are more robust.<br><br>3. Bagging and Random Forests<br>Bagging is an ensemble method involving training the same algorithm many times using different subsets sampled from the training data. In this chapter, you'll understand how bagging can be used to create a tree ensemble. You'll also learn how the random forests algorithm can lead to further ensemble diversity through randomization at the level of each split in the trees forming the ensemble.<br><br>4. Boosting<br>Boosting refers to an ensemble method in which several models are trained sequentially with each model learning from the errors of its predecessors. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the two boosting methods of AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.<br><br>5. Model Tuning<br>The hyperparameters of a machine learning model are parameters that are not learned from data. They should be set prior to fitting the model to the training set. In this chapter, you'll learn how to tune the hyperparameters of a tree-based model using grid search cross validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 100%         |
| Predicting Movie Rental Durations                           | Build a regression model for a DVD rental firm to predict rental duration. Evaluate models to recommend the best one.<br><br>Time to put your regression knowledge to the test! A DVD rental company has approached you to make a regression model which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The model will hopefully make their inventory planning much more efficient. You decide to help them by running some regression models and recommending the best-performing model to the company.<br><br>Python<br>Use Python to build a project that has a specific solution, with guided tasks and real-time automated code checks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 100%         |
