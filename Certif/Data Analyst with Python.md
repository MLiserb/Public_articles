You will also be introduced to one of the big advantages of using Seaborn - the ability to easily add a third variable to your plots by using color to represent different subgroups.<br><br>2. Visualizing Two Quantitative Variables<br>In this chapter, you will create and customize plots that visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables. To do this, you will use scatter plots and line plots to explore how the level of air pollution in a city changes over the course of a day and how horsepower relates to fuel efficiency in cars. You will also see another big advantage of using Seaborn - the ability to easily create subplots in a single figure!<br><br>3. Visualizing a Categorical and a Quantitative Variable<br>Categorical variables are present in nearly every dataset, but they are especially prominent in survey data. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and customize categorical plots such as box plots, bar plots, count plots, and point plots. Along the way, you will explore survey data from young people about their interests, students about their study habits, and adult men about their feelings about masculinity.<br><br>4.Customizing Seaborn Plots<br>In this final chapter, you will learn how to add informative plot titles and axis labels, which are one of the most important parts of any data visualization! You will also learn how to customize the style of your visualizations in order to more quickly orient your audience to the key takeaways. Then, you will put everything you have learned together for the final exercises of the course! | 100%                                         |

| Exploratory Data Analysis in Python                      | So you’ve got some interesting data - where do you begin your analysis? This course will cover the process of exploring and analyzing data, from understanding what’s included in a dataset to incorporating exploration findings into a data science workflow.<br><br>Using data on unemployment figures and plane ticket prices, you’ll leverage Python to summarize and validate data, calculate, identify and replace missing values, and clean both numerical and categorical values. Throughout the course, you’ll create beautiful Seaborn visualizations to understand variables and their relationships.<br><br>For example, you’ll examine how alcohol use and student performance are related. Finally, the course will show how exploratory findings feed into data science workflows by creating new features, balancing categorical features, and generating hypotheses from findings.<br><br>By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence to perform your own exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.You’ll be able to explain your findings visually to others and suggest the next steps for gathering insights from your data!<br><br>1. Getting to Know a Dataset<br>What's the best way to approach a new dataset? Learn to validate and summarize categorical and numerical data and create Seaborn visualizations to communicate your findings.<br><br>2. Data Cleaning and Imputation<br>Exploring and analyzing data often means dealing with missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers. In this chapter, you’ll learn techniques to handle these issues and streamline your EDA processes!<br><br>3.Relationships in Data<br>Variables in datasets don't exist in a vacuum; they have relationships with each other. In this chapter, you'll look at relationships across numerical, categorical, and even DateTime data, exploring the direction and strength of these relationships as well as ways to visualize them.<br><br>4.

| Sampling in Python                                       | Sampling in Python is the cornerstone of inference statistics and hypothesis testing. It's a powerful skill used in survey analysis and experimental design to draw conclusions without surveying an entire population. In this Sampling in Python course, you’ll discover when to use sampling and how to perform common types of sampling—from simple random sampling to more complex methods like stratified and cluster sampling. Using real-world datasets, including coffee ratings, Spotify songs, and employee attrition, you’ll learn to estimate population statistics and quantify uncertainty in your estimates by generating sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions.<br><br>1. Introduction to Sampling<br>Learn what sampling is and why it is so powerful. You’ll also learn about the problems caused by convenience sampling and the differences between true randomness and pseudo-randomness.<br><br>2. Sampling Methods<br>It’s time to get hands-on and perform the four random sampling methods in Python: simple, systematic, stratified, and cluster.<br><br>3. Sampling Distributions<br>Let’s test your sampling. In this chapter, you’ll discover how to quantify the accuracy of sample statistics using relative errors, and measure variation in your estimates by generating sampling distributions.<br><br>4. Bootstrap Distributions<br>You’ll get to grips with resampling to perform bootstrapping and estimate variation in an unknown population. You’ll learn the difference between sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions using resampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 100%                                         |
| Hypothesis Testing in Python                             | Hypothesis testing lets you answer questions about your datasets in a statistically rigorous way. In this course, you'll grow your Python analytical skills as you learn how and when to use common tests like t-tests, proportion tests, and chi-square tests. Working with real-world data, including Stack Overflow user feedback and supply-chain data for medical supply shipments, you'll gain a deep understanding of how these tests work and the key assumptions that underpin them. You'll also discover how non-parametric tests can be used to go beyond the limitations of traditional hypothesis tests.<br><br>1. Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals<br>How does hypothesis testing work and what problems can it solve? To find out, you’ll walk through the workflow for a one sample proportion test. In doing so, you'll encounter important concepts like z-scores, p-values, and false negative and false positive errors.<br><br>2. Two-Sample and ANOVA Tests<br>In this chapter, you’ll learn how to test for differences in means between two groups using t-tests and extend this to more than two groups using ANOVA and pairwise t-tests.<br><br>3. Proportion Tests<br>Now it’s time to test for differences in proportions between two groups using proportion tests. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll extend your proportion tests to more than two groups with chi-square independence tests, and return to the one sample case with chi-square goodness of fit tests.<br><br>4.
