| Introduction to SQL                           | Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transactions—is stored in relational databases, and the ability to manipulate and retrieve this data is an increasingly sought-after skill.<br><br>In this two-hour introduction to SQL, you'll learn the theory and practice of extracting and organizing data. You'll cover database best practices, SQL queries, and popular SQL variants like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. By the end of the course, you’ll have hands-on experience in SQL and the grounding to start applying it to your projects.<br><br>1. Relational Databases<br>Before writing any SQL queries, it’s important to understand the underlying data. In this chapter, we’ll discover the role of SQL in creating and querying relational databases. Using a database for a local library, we will explore database and table organization, data types and storage, and best practices for database construction.<br><br>2. Querying<br>Learn your first SQL keywords for selecting relevant data from database tables! After practicing querying skills in a database of books, you’ll customize query results using aliasing and save them as views so they can be shared. Finally, you’ll explore the differences between SQL flavors and databases such as PostgreSQL and SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 100%      |
