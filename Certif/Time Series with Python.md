| Manipulating Time Series Data in Python         | In this course you'll learn the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. You'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. You'll also learn how resample time series to change the frequency. This course will also show you how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, you'll use all your new skills to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data.<br><br>1. Working with Time Series in Pandas<br>This chapter lays the foundations to leverage the powerful time series functionality made available by how Pandas represents dates, in particular by the DateTimeIndex. You will learn how to create and manipulate date information and time series, and how to do calculations with time-aware DataFrames to shift your data in time or create period-specific returns.<br><br>2. Basic Time Series Metrics & Resampling<br>This chapter dives deeper into the essential time series functionality made available through the pandas DataTimeIndex. It introduces resampling and how to compare different time series by normalizing their start points.<br><br>3.

| Visualizing Time Series Data in Python<br><br>  | Time series data is omnipresent in the field of Data Science. Whether it is analyzing business trends, forecasting company revenue or exploring customer behavior, every data scientist is likely to encounter time series data at some point during their work. To get you started on working with time series data, this course will provide practical knowledge on visualizing time series data using Python.<br><br>1. Line Plots<br>You will learn how to leverage basic plottings tools in Python, and how to annotate and personalize your time series plots. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to take any static dataset and produce compelling plots of your data.<br><br>2. Summary Statistics and Diagnostics<br>In this chapter, you will gain a deeper understanding of your time series data by computing summary statistics and plotting aggregated views of your data.<br><br>3. Seasonality, Trend and Noise<br>You will go beyond summary statistics by learning about autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots. You will also learn how to automatically detect seasonality, trend and noise in your time series data.<br><br>4. Work with Multiple Time Series<br>In the field of Data Science, it is common to be involved in projects where multiple time series need to be studied simultaneously. In this chapter, we will show you how to plot multiple time series at once, and how to discover and describe relationships between multiple time series.<br><br>5. Case Study: Unemployment Rate<br>This chapter will give you a chance to practice all the concepts covered in the course. You will visualize the unemployment rate in the US from 2000 to 2010.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 100%      |
| ARIMA Models in Python                          | Have you ever tried to predict the future? What lies ahead is a mystery which is usually only solved by waiting. In this course, you will stop waiting and learn to use the powerful ARIMA  class models to forecast the future. You will learn how to use the statsmodels package to analyze time series, to build tailored models, and to forecast under uncertainty. How will the stock market move in the next 24 hours? How will the levels of CO2 change in the next decade? How many earthquakes will there be next year? You will learn to solve all these problems and more.<br><br>1. ARMA Models<br>Dive straight in and learn about the most important properties of time series. You'll learn about stationarity and how this is important for ARMA models. You'll learn how to test for stationarity by eye and with a standard statistical test. Finally, you'll learn the basic structure of ARMA models and use this to generate some ARMA data and fit an ARMA model.<br><br>2. Fitting the Future<br>What lies ahead in this chapter is you predicting what lies ahead in your data. You'll learn how to use the elegant statsmodels package to fit ARMA, ARIMA and ARMAX models. Then you'll use your models to predict the uncertain future of stock prices!<br><br>3. The Best of the Best Models<br>In this chapter, you will become a modeler of discerning taste. You'll learn how to identify promising model orders from the data itself, then, once the most promising models have been trained, you'll learn how to choose the best model from this fitted selection. You'll also learn a great framework for structuring your time series projects.<br><br>4. Seasonal ARIMA Models<br>In this final chapter, you'll learn how to use seasonal ARIMA models to fit more complex data.

| Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python | Time series data is ubiquitous. Whether it be stock market fluctuations, sensor data recording climate change, or activity in the brain, any signal that changes over time can be described as a time series. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful method for leveraging complexity in data in order to generate predictions and insights into the problem one is trying to solve. This course is an intersection between these two worlds of machine learning and time series data, and covers feature engineering, spectograms, and other advanced techniques in order to classify heartbeat sounds and predict stock prices.<br><br>1. Time Series and Machine Learning Primer<br>This chapter is an introduction to the basics of machine learning, time series data, and the intersection between the two.<br><br>2. Time Series as Inputs to a Model<br>The easiest way to incorporate time series into your machine learning pipeline is to use them as features in a model. This chapter covers common features that are extracted from time series in order to do machine learning.<br><br>3. Predicting Time Series Data<br>If you want to predict patterns from data over time, there are special considerations to take in how you choose and construct your model. This chapter covers how to gain insights into the data before fitting your model, as well as best-practices in using predictive modeling for time series data.<br><br>4. Validating and Inspecting Time Series Models<br>Once you've got a model for predicting time series data, you need to decide if it's a good or a bad model. This chapter coves the basics of generating predictions with models in order to validate them against "test" data.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 100%      |
