After taking this course, you'll be ready to tackle many data challenges Pythonically.<br><br>1. Fundamental Sequence Data Types<br>This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental Python data types - lists, sets, and strings. These data containers are critical as they provide the basis for storing and looping over ordered data. To make things interesting, you'll apply what you learn about these types to answer questions about the New York Baby Names dataset!<br><br>2. Dictionaries - The Root of Python<br>At the root of all things Python is a dictionary. Herein, you'll learn how to use them to safely handle data that can viewed in a variety of ways to answer even more questions about the New York Baby Names dataset. You'll explore how to loop through data in a dictionary, access nested data, add new data, and come to appreciate all of the wonderful capabilities of Python dictionaries.<br><br>3. Numeric Data Types, Booleans, and Sets<br>Let's take a step away from dictionaries and look at some other common numeric and boolean data types along with sets.<br><br>4. Advanced Data Types<br>Some data types are composites of other data types and give me even more capabilities than a fundamental data type. Let's explore a few complex types from the collections module and data classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 100%      |
| Working with Dates and Times in Python                | You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion.<br><br>1. Dates and Calendars<br>Hurricanes (also known as cyclones or typhoons) hit the U.S. state of Florida several times per year. To start off this course, you'll learn how to work with date objects in Python, starting with the dates of every hurricane to hit Florida since 1950. You'll learn how Python handles dates, common date operations, and the right way to format dates to avoid confusion.<br><br>2. Combining Dates and Times<br>Bike sharing programs have swept through cities around the world -- and luckily for us, every trip gets recorded! Working with all of the comings and goings of one bike in Washington, D.C., you'll practice working with dates and times together. You'll parse dates and times from text, analyze peak trip times, calculate ride durations, and more.<br><br>3. Time Zones and Daylight Saving<br>In this chapter, you'll learn to confidently tackle the time-related topic that causes people the most trouble: time zones and daylight saving. Continuing with our bike data, you'll learn how to compare clocks around the world, how to gracefully handle "spring forward" and "fall back," and how to get up-to-date timezone data from the dateutil library.<br><br>4. Easy and Powerful: Dates and Times in Pandas<br>To conclude this course, you'll apply everything you've learned about working with dates and times in standard Python to working with dates and times in Pandas. With additional information about each bike ride, such as what station it started and stopped at and whether or not the rider had a yearly membership, you'll be able to dig much more deeply into the bike trip data. In this chapter, you'll cover powerful Pandas operations, such as grouping and plotting results by time. | 100%      |

| Introduction to Shell                                 | The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost 50 years because it lets people do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called "the universal glue of programming," it helps users combine existing programs in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds that may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.<br><br>1. Manipulating files and directories<br>This chapter is a brief introduction to the Unix shell. You'll learn why it is still in use after almost 50 years, how it compares to the graphical tools you may be more familiar with, how to move around in the shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.<br><br>2. Manipulating data<br>The commands you saw in the previous chapter allowed you to move things around in the filesystem. This chapter will show you how to work with the data in those files. The tools we’ll use are fairly simple, but are solid building blocks.<br><br>3. Combining tools<br>The real power of the Unix shell lies not in the individual commands, but in how easily they can be combined to do new things. This chapter will show you how to use this power to select the data you want, and introduce commands for sorting values and removing duplicates.<br><br>4. Batch processing<br>Most shell commands will process many files at once. This chapter shows you how to make your own pipelines do that.
