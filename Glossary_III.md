| **Backups and Snapshots**                                                | Backups are copies of files, operating systems, settings, and more that are stored in a separate location in case of disk failure or data loss. Snapshots do the same thing as backups but are usually used in storage arrays or SANs at an enterprise level and are more focused on capturing a point in time. All snapshots start with a full backup. A full backup or snapshot copies everything on a disk selected for backup. A differential backup or snapshot copies only the files that changed since the last full backup. An incremental backup or snapshot copies only the files that changed since any backup. Backups and snapshots can be automated or manual. If you delete the original instance of the data, only manual backups are retained. With important data, it is best to keep three backups or snapshots saved locally and in the cloud. Sometimes data can become corrupted. Backups and snapshots should be tested periodically to ensure they are still able to restore the data. |
| **Bad Sectors**                                                          | Corrupted disk areas that indicate a partial disk failure. A “bad sectors” error message displays when this occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Block Storage**                                                        | A type of storage that splits data into fixed blocks and stores them with unique identifiers. Blocks can be stored in different environments (like one block in Linux and the rest in Windows). When a block is retrieved, it’s reassembled with associated blocks to recreate the original data. Block storage is the default storage for data that is frequently updated; is fast, reliable, and easy to change; has no metadata, is not searchable, and is expensive; and it’s often used in databases and email servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Domain Name System. (DNS)**                                            | A protocol that resolves or translates domain names to IP addresses. The default port for DNS is 53. DNS is a server that keeps a record of all the URLs and IP addresses that are associated with one another. When you type a URL, like [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/), into a browser and press enter, the browser sends the URL to the DNS server. The DNS server replies with the proper IP address. Your browser will connect to the IP address provided. Because number-only IP addresses are not as easy for people to remember, DNS translates easy-to-remember web addresses to number-only addresses and ensures that both network devices and the people that use them know where they’re going. (Also called Domain Name Service and Domain Name Server.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Ethernet (‘twisted-pair’) Cables**                                     | Cables that consist of four pairs of twisted wires to reduce interference. These cables ‘hardwire’ a computer to a LAN. Hardwiring is faster and more consistent than Wi-Fi. They are available in two types – shielded wires or unshielded wires. Unshielded Twisted Pair, or UTP, cables are cheaper and more common. Shielded Twisted Pair, or STP, cables are more expensive and designed to reduce any outside interference that might interrupt data transmission. Ethernet cables also have category numbers. A higher category number means the cable is newer and usually faster with better bandwidth. Category, distance, and bandwidth are factors that are considered when building networks using ethernet. There are many types and categories of ethernet cables, and while all of them use the same connector on both ends, mixing up types can damage cables or hardware.                                                                                                                    |

| **Network Address Translation (NAT)**                                    | A process that maps multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers. NAT conserves public IP addresses and improves security. When data packets arrive at the public IP address, the NAT instructions send all data packets without revealing the private IP addresses of the intended destinations. That single network device acts as an intermediary between the private network and the Internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Proxy server**                                                         | A device that acts as an intermediary between a LAN and the Internet to minimize security risks. The proxy server evaluates requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate server if those requests meet preset security requirements. Proxy servers hide an IP address.

| **Ring Topology network**                                                | Connects all devices in a circular ring pattern where data only flows in a clockwise direction. Each device receives and passes on the data until it reaches the intended recipient device, which then processes the data. Ring topology works better in smaller networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Router**                                                               | A device that interconnects different networks or subnetworks. Routers manage traffic between networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and they allow multiple devices to use the same Internet connection. Routers connect to modems. To direct packets effectively, a router uses an internal routing table which is a list of paths to various network destinations. The router reads a packet’s header to determine its path, consults the routing table to figure out the most efficient path, then forwards the packet to the next network in the path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Serial Cable**                                                         | Used to transfer information between two devices using the RS-232 standard, which states that data bits must flow in a line, one after another, over the cable. Serial cables are used in modems, keyboards, mice, and other peripheral devices which is why serial cables are sometimes called “peripheral cables”. However, video and multipurpose cables are also called “peripheral cables” for the same reason even though they might not use the RS-232 standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **SOHO Network Router**                                                  | A router that automatically assigns IP addresses to each device on the network, which is necessary if you intend to share your Internet connection with all the connected devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **SOHO Network Security (wired)**                                        | Primarily depends on a firewall since all data packets in a wired network travel through secure Ethernet cables. Most broadband routers have a built-in firewall and additional software firewalls can be installed on individual machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **SOHO Network Switch**                                                  | Allows 4 to 8 connected devices to talk to each other but does not assign IP addresses or provide Internet. Switches are best used to expand the number of LAN ports available on the network since the number of ports on a router can be limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **SOHO Wired Network (Small Office/Home Office)**                        | A local area network, or LAN, with less than 10 computers. It can be wired or wireless. SOHO networks need a switch to act as the hub of the network. If the Internet is desired, a router can be used instead. SOHO routers often have other integrated features, like a cable or DSL modem, switch ports, and a built-in firewall. A modem provides an Internet connection. Ethernet Cables provide a wired connection. Category 5, 5E, and 6 cables are the current standard. SOHO networks often use email, website, and cloud subscription services since maintenance and reliability are included. Internet is provided via cable, DSL, or ISDN. Basic equipment maintenance is easy since there are only a handful of devices and cables to consider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **SOHO Wireless Network (Small Office/Home Office)**                     | A wireless local area network, or WLAN, that serves a small physical space with a small number of employees or home users. A SOHO wireless network can be configured with the help of a central wireless access point, or WAP, which can cover a range of wireless devices within a small office or home. SOHO networks often use email, website, and cloud subscription services since maintenance and reliability are included. Basic equipment maintenance is easy since there are only a handful of devices and cables to consider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Solid-state Drive (SSD)**                                              | A storage drive that is the fastest storage option. It has no moving parts, doesn’t need power to retain data, and can read, write, and fetch faster than any HDD (up to 7000 MB/s, as opposed to 200 MB/s with HDDs). SSDs are the new standard for PC storage. They are small, fast, and durable, but also expensive, with limited capacity, and they can fail suddenly. SSDs are best for activities that require speed, like browsing online or editing large files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Solid-state Hybrid Drive (SSHD)**                                      | A storage drive that integrates the speed of an SSD and the capacity of an HDD into a single device. It decides what to store in solid-state versus hard disk based on user activity. SSHDs are faster than HDDs, offer better performance than HDDs, cost less than pure SSDs, and have higher capacities than SSDs. Hard drives and solid-state hybrid drives are sometimes referred to as spinning drives because they use spinning plates to read, write, and fetch data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Choose a longer, harder to guess key for stronger security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)**                                    | Covers large areas such as neighboring towns and cities. WWAN is used for mobile access to the Internet from outdoor areas. Provides regional, nationwide, and global wireless coverage. This includes private networks of multinational corporations, the Internet, cellular networks like 4G, 5G, Long-Term Evolution (or LTE), and LoRaWAN (which is a low-power WAN protocol built on top of the techniques used in long-range radio—modulation). Advantages include: global wireless coverage, better security than WLAN, and centralized flexible infrastructure (like cloud apps and storage). Disadvantages include: expensive, difficult to maintain, and decreased coverage over large areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)**              | The family of wireless communication standards provide WMAN broadband connectivity. There are similar open-source and proprietary broadband technologies, but WiMAX is the accepted suite of standards based on IEEE 802.16. Advantages include: covers multiple city locations, easy to use, extend, and exchange, and managed by an ISP, government entity, or corporation. Disadvantages include: requires special user permissions, less secure, and slower than wired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Workgroup, or Homegroup**                                              | A group of computers on a small office/home office (SOHO) network, typically without a server. Data is stored on the user device that created it. To share files and folders, users set them to ‘public.’ The added points of failure (scattered data on multiple devices) create a higher risk of data loss. Newer cloud solutions provide the same features more securely. Workgroups and homegroups are less common. Homegroups have been removed from Windows 10 altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
