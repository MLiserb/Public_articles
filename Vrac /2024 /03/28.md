ChatGPT now helps you backtest Simple Trading Strategies.

No more wasting 100's of hours building code from scratch for bad ideas.

Here’s how to do it for free, in less than 10-minutes:

1. Choice of Libraries

Begin with the required Libraries.

We can ask ChatGPT to get them for us.

Prompt → "Could you provide the Python code to import the necessary libraries for backtesting a trading strategy, focusing on data handling from Yahoo Finance and visualization?"

2. Data Retrieval from Yahoo Finance

Now we need data for our backtest.

Let's use Yahoo Finance data for this.

Prompt → "How can I use Python to retrieve Bitcoin (BTC-USD) historical price data (daily OHLC and volume) from Yahoo Finance, starting from January 1, 2020?"

3. Define the Strategy

We will build the simplest of strategies:

- A SMA crossover strategy.

Prompt → "With the Bitcoin data available, could you guide me through defining a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy in Python using pandas?"

4. Implement the Backtest

Now we want to analyze the performance of the strategy.

Prompt → "Now that the strategy is defined, how can I implement the backtest in Python using pandas, calculating the strategy's performance?"

5. Analyze the Results and Visualize

We also want to see the returns on a plot.

Prompt → "Finally, how can I use pandas and matplotlib to analyze the backtest's key performance metrics and visualize the equity curve for the SMA crossover strategy on Bitcoin data?"

6. Adjustments

You must have noticed that the drawdown chart was not being accurately calculated.

So I had to do some manual changes to make sure it plotted the right information.

This is where some basic knowledge of python is important.

---
The higher the complexity of the strategy, the more manual adjustments you'll have to make.

This is why me (@pedma7) and my friend @GoshawkTrades help traders turn their strategy ideas into code.

If you have ideas you can't test, feel free to reach out to him directly, or to me.

I hope you've enjoyed this short thread on how to turn a simple trading idea into code.

It took less than 10-minutes to go from nothing to a backtest.

Now you can explore other ideas on your own and start being more systematic with your trading.

Have a good day!
